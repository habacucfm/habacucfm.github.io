After a few months of hard work the WTF (Wood, Termite and Fungi) project is live! We've deployed literally thousands of wood blocks (*Pinus radiata* and some native woods) across a precipitation gradient in Australia to investigate the relative role of fungi, termite and plant traits in wood decomposition.
