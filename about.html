## About

My research interest is at the crossroad between population ecology, community ecology and ecosystems ecology. I use a combination of tools such as, functional traits, demographic census and environmental information to understand:

- Trait integration within and across organs
- The effect of the environment on community structure and trait distribution
- Relationships between functional traits and fitness
- Invasive species ecology
